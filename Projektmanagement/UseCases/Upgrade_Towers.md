# Use-Case Specification: Upgrade Towers

# 1. Upgrade Towers

## 1.1 Brief Description
This use case allows players to upgrade towers that they have already placed on the map. 
This is a necessary feature for the game since the enemies in a level are getting stronger with each wave. 
Since the space to place towers on the map is limited, the only way for the player to be able to handle stronger waves is to upgrade to stronger towers.
