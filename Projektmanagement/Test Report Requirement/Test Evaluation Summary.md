# Test Evaluation Summary

## 1.	Introduction

### 1.1	Purpose
The purpose of the Evaluation Summary is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. 
It describes the approach to testing the software.
This Test Plan for TowerDefense supports the following objectives:
-	Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.
-	Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
-	Outlines the testing approach that will be used.
-	Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2	Scope
This document describes the used unit tests in C#.

### 1.3	Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
This document is meant for internal use primarily.

### 1.5 Overview
The rest of the document describes the results of the tests we did for our C# scripts. Because it was not possible for us to test our game as a whole,
our only solution was to test the raw functionality of our game which lies in the C# scripts.
