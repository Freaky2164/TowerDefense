## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides an overview of our software architecture. With several different architectural views it depicts different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made for the system.


### 1.2 Scope
This document describes the architecture of the TowerDefense project.

### 1.5 Overview
This document contains the architectural representation, goals and constraints as well 
as the logical, deployment, implementation and data views.

## 2 Architectural Representation 
[This section describes what software architecture is for the current system, and how it is represented. Of the Use-Case, Logical, Process, Deployment, and Implementation Views, it enumerates the views that are necessary, and for each view, explains what types of model elements it contains.]

## 3 Architectural Goals and Constraints 
Our game is based on an event-driven software architecture design with mediator topology. The game will be developed entirely with Unity using C#-Scripts for coding the logic. We plan to make the game portable to all mobile devices and plan to make them available on app stores.

## 4 Use-Case View 
[This section lists use cases or scenarios from the use-case model if they represent some significant, central functionality of the final system, or if they have a large architectural coverageâ€”they exercise many architectural elements or if they stress or illustrate a specific, delicate point of the architecture.]
### 4.1	Use-Case Realizations
[This section illustrates how the software actually works by giving a few selected use-case (or scenario) realizations, and explains how the various design model elements contribute to their functionality.]

## 5 Logical View 
[This section describes the architecturally significant parts of the design model, such as its decomposition into subsystems and packages. And for each significant package, its decomposition into classes and class utilities. You should introduce architecturally significant classes and describe their responsibilities, as well as a few very important relationships, operations, and attributes.]

### 5.1	Overview
[This subsection describes the overall decomposition of the design model in terms of its package hierarchy and layers.]

### 5.2	Architecturally Significant Design Packages
[For each significant package, include a subsection with its name, its brief description, and a diagram with all significant classes and packages contained within the package. 
For each significant class in the package, include its name, brief description, and, optionally, a description of some of its major responsibilities, operations, and attributes.]

## 6 Process View 
Here you can see our sequence diagrams for the two main scenarios in our game:

 - Scenario 1: You are in the menu and you want to start a new game either by creating a new one or by loading a previous one.

 - Scenario 2: You are already in a game and able to place towers, using them to shoot enemies and rewarding you with money you can use to buy more tower

## 7 Deployment View 
[This section describes one or more physical network (hardware) configurations on which the software is deployed and run. It is a view of the Deployment Model. At a minimum for each configuration it should indicate the physical nodes (computers, CPUs) that execute the software and their interconnections (bus, LAN, point-to-point, and so on.) Also include a mapping of the processes of the Process View onto the physical nodes.]

## 8 Implementation View 
In our implementation we only use one system which consists of all the needed components in our game. Here you can have a quick overview of the different components and their functionalities:

 - GameHandler: This is the main component of the game responsible for creating and starting new waves of enemies, creating the Financial System and handling                 the interaction when an enemy is beind destroyed.
 - EnemyHandler: This component is used to control the waves of enemies by configuring which and how many enemies each wave is going to consist of.
 - EnemySpawner: This component is being called when a new wave of enemies should be created.
 - Enemy: The enemy component is used for every enemy in the game holding the informations about their health and their reward money.
 - Tower: The tower component is what the user can directly interact with by placing them onto the map. They have a range, attack speed and attack damage and           automatically shot at enemies within their range if a round is currently running.
 - Financial System: This component is used for handling the money a player has, increasing it for defeated enemies and decreasing it for buying towers

## 9 Size and Performance
Since our game will be ported on mobile apps we keep in mind that the required memory space should be minimized and we plan to increase the otherall efficiency. 
[A description of the major dimensioning characteristics of the software that impact the architecture, as well as the target performance constraints.]

## 10 Quality 
For our game we will be focusing on Performance using Framerates per Seconds as a measurement for how good the performance is. The framerate of a game is nowadays probably one of the most important quality attributes in the gaming industry. Thats why we try to aim for the optimal structure of our game objects. We want to minimize the initializations of different objects as much as possible and we also seek out to reduze the use of more expensive functions that would lead to the same outcome.<br><br>
Usability is our second most important quality attribute. It should be measured by the time users play and enjoy our game. Our game should be easy to use and players should quicky understand how the game mechanics are working.<br><br>
Availability is not so important for our game. It is measured by the time how long the game is running without any crashes. We try to detect errors during the runtime of the game but if a bug occurs it is likely that the game crashes. We should then try to work on fixing those bugs.
