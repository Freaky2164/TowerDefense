## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes all specifications for the application "Tower Defense". It includes an overview about this project and its vision, detailed information about the planned features and boundary conditions of the development process.


### 1.2 Scope
We are going to create a simple Tower Defense game that runs on Android Phones
When you open the application you are presented with a menu where you can choose between a Start, Load, Quit and Settings Button.
If you start or load the game you get forwarded to the game map.

The map should be split in 2 Parts:

- The way through the map where enemies walk to your base to decrease your HP
- A place where you can place your turrets to defend your base!

The main goal is to survive multiple waves of enemies which can be achieved by buying and upgrading towers.
This towers can then be placed on the map and automatically shoot the enemies walking along the path
