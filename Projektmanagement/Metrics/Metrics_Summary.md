# Metrics

The metric we want to keep an eye on in our project is source code complexity because all further improvements of our game rely on the quality of current source code. 
If our code is already of poor quality then we run the risk of not being able to maintain our code in the future.

We measure our source code complexity by using the following three metrics:

## Halsteadâ€™s program volume



## Cyclomatic complexity



## Weighted methods per class (WMC)
